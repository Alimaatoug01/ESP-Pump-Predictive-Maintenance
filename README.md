# ESP-Pump-Predictive-Maintenance
This repository encompasses a predictive maintenance project centered around Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) systems. The project leverages Machine Learning models, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to forecast failures in ESP pumps with a lead time of up to 10 days before the actual occurrence.
