# ESP Pump Predictive Maintenance

This repository contains a predictive maintenance project focused on Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) systems. The project utilizes Machine Learning models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict failures in ESP pumps with a lead time of up to 10 days before the actual occurrence.

## Data Hosting

The dataset used in this project is hosted on MEGA. You can access the data using the following link:

[ESP Pump Dataset on MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/xqUUETSa#CVyWGbdFBFgYHZUO3eW4RQ)

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Explore and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for machine learning model training.
- **MLP Model:** Implement and train a Multilayer Perceptron model for predicting pump failures.
- **LSTM Model:** Utilize Long Short-Term Memory networks with TensorFlow and Keras for accurate failure forecasts.
- **Evaluation Notebooks:** Assess model performance through comprehensive evaluation notebooks with metrics and visualizations.
- **Model Artifacts:** Access saved LSTM model architecture (`modellstm.json`) and weights (`modellstm.h5`) for easy reproduction.

## How to Use

1. **Explore Notebooks:** Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to find step-by-step guides on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. **Access Model Artifacts:** Retrieve the saved LSTM model architecture and weights from the `models/` directory.
